Not that, we need a log file, statistics and performance information.
Logger:
  What do we need to include in a logger?
  Time:Run Time: Class Method  Note
  What about statistics?
  Have a csv file
  run time
  how many loops
  animations running
  how long some thing took
  modes or windows
  user time in a scene...etc.
  
So what we need to do next is add input from the user, animations,
images and sound.

After these basic components, start on APIs for interface components.

Input:
  Right now the input is a queue which is read from each cycle.
  This is synchronized input.
  We may need asynchronous input for faster paced games.
  Should there be an option to choose?
  I think that having both options would be useful.
  The programmer can use the queue when the program doesn't need to respond immediately.
  Else they can have the scene react right away.
  This would also be based on which scene they are in.
  Ex; A menu doesn't generally need asynchronous responses.
