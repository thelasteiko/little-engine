Need to find some way to handle input generically
The way it's done in the tutorial it just checks
to see if a button is pressed and executes some if statement

button_down(id) is the method called in Gosu::Window whenever
a button is pressed
if I used this method we can create a hash much like i have
already to register the button presses with an input manager
That way when the scene changes, the input changes without
having a long listing of conditions

add up a running counter with ticks until the counter >= 1000

The mouse can be followed by using mouse_x and mouse_y
button_down handles the press of a mouse button as well as the keyboard
