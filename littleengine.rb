This is a basic game engine meant for expirementation
and learning. It's overly commented without too many
bells and whistles. It probably has some bad habits
and is not the most efficient design.

If you want a serious game engine, this is not it.
If you want a framework that's easy to play with
then you're in the right place.

All resources used are easy to find and install. As
a note, this was created using Ruby 2.2.4.23 on
Windows 7. Please see the README for directions
on how to run this demo.

THIS IS THE DEBUG VERSION. It has an optional debug window to display
error messages in.
